# O-ber - Ride Sharing Backend

O-ber is a robust backend system for a ride-sharing application, built with Django and Python. It leverages modern technologies to provide real-time features like driver tracking, ride requests, and live chat, alongside standard RESTful APIs for user management and booking operations.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Django 5.1 & Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Real-time:** Django Channels (Daphne), WebSocket
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS (for geospatial data)
- **Async Tasks:** Celery with Redis
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **Authentication:** JWT (SimpleJWT)
- **KYC Service:** FastAPI based (microservice)

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is structured into modular Django apps:

- **`accounts`**: User authentication, profiles (Rider/Driver), OTP verification.
- **`riders`**: Ride management, booking requests, ride history.
- **`drivers`**: Driver availability, shift tracking, ride acceptance.
- **`dashboard`**: Admin/Platform level operations (Admin Dashboard APIs).
- **`payments`**: Stripe Checkout integration & Transaction management.
- **`api`**: Centralized API URL routing.

## ✨ Key Features

- **User Roles:** Distinct Rider and Driver profiles with specialized onboarding flows.
- **Geospatial Logic:**
    - Real-time location updates using PostGIS.
    - Proximity-based driver discovery.
- **Live WebSocket Features:**
    - **Driver Discovery:** Drivers receive ride requests in real-time.
    - **Trip Tracking:** Riders see driver location updates live.
    - **In-Ride Chat:** Real-time chat between rider and driver.
- **Driver Verification:** KYC flow for uploading license and vehicle documents.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Comprehensive APIs for managing users, drivers, and platform settings.
- **Payments:** Stripe Checkout Sessions flow for secure ride payments.
